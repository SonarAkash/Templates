1. Byte Stream Hierarchy (for raw binary data)
The root classes for byte streams are:

InputStream (for reading raw binary data)
OutputStream (for writing raw binary data)
Subclasses of InputStream:
ByteArrayInputStream: Reads data from a byte array as an input stream.
FileInputStream: Reads data from a file.
ObjectInputStream: Reads objects previously written using ObjectOutputStream.
PipedInputStream: Reads data from a piped output stream (used in multithreading).
BufferedInputStream: Adds buffering to reduce I/O operations.
DataInputStream: Reads primitive data types (int, float, etc.) from an input stream.
Subclasses of OutputStream:
ByteArrayOutputStream: Writes data to a byte array as an output stream.
FileOutputStream: Writes data to a file.
ObjectOutputStream: Writes objects to an output stream (serialization).
PipedOutputStream: Writes data to a piped input stream.
BufferedOutputStream: Adds buffering to reduce I/O operations.
DataOutputStream: Writes primitive data types (int, float, etc.) to an output stream.
PrintStream: Writes formatted representations of objects (e.g., System.out).
