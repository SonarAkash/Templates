// EXPLAINATION 

/*
 * NOW IN THE SETTING DOES THE AWAIT() METHOD ALSO RELEASES LOCK ON THE OBJECT ? IF YES THEN HOW CAUSE WE RELEASE THE LOCK IN THE LATER PART I.E FINALLY BLOCK ?
ChatGPT said:

ANSWER : =>

Yes ‚Äî await() does release the lock immediately when it‚Äôs called, even though you also have lock.unlock() later in the finally block.

The key is: await() is not the same as returning from the method.


üîç Step-by-step of what await() does


When you call:

counterNotEmpty.await();

inside a block protected by lock.lock(), here‚Äôs what happens internally:

You already hold the lock (lock.lock() was called earlier).

await():

Releases the lock (so other threads can acquire it).

Places the current thread in the wait set for that specific Condition.

Suspends the thread (similar to Object.wait()).

Later, when another thread calls signal() or signalAll() on the same Condition:

The waiting thread is moved from the wait set to the entry queue of the same lock.

The awakened thread must re-acquire the lock before await() returns.

Once it re-acquires the lock, execution continues after the await() call.

Eventually, when the method reaches the finally block, then lock.unlock() is called, releasing the lock for real at method exit.


üîÑ How this differs from lock.unlock() in finally

lock.unlock() in finally is for normal method exit (successful or due to exception).

await() temporarily gives up the lock mid-method, allowing other threads to run inside the same lock-protected region.

After await() returns, the lock is already re-acquired, so code after it is still in a protected state.


Example Timeline in Your Code

Two waiters, one chef:

Waiter-1 calls serveDish() ‚Üí finds empty ‚Üí calls await() ‚Üí releases lock.

Waiter-2 can now also enter serveDish(), finds empty, calls await() ‚Üí releases lock.

Chef calls placeDish() ‚Üí adds food ‚Üí calls signal() ‚Üí wakes up one waiter.

That waiter re-acquires the lock, continues after await(), serves dish.

When method ends, lock.unlock() in finally is called.


üí° So the answer is:
Yes, await() releases the lock immediately when called ‚Äî it‚Äôs built into the mechanism of Condition.await().
The later lock.unlock() in finally is unrelated to the lock release inside await(); it‚Äôs for cleaning up when you leave the method entirely.
